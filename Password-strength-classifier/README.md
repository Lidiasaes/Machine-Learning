I built a **Random Forest classifier** by using different data I found in Kaggle:

      https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prasertk/top-200-passwords-by-country-2021

    &

      https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/10000-most-common-passwords

    &

      https://www.kaggle.com/code/bhaveshvss/password-strength-checker/input






[EXTRA] This is a good project as well
